# genf
genf.py - A Python script to automatically extract file names and contents from a specified folder. Outputs results to a text file named after the folder. Excludes folders like `node_modules` and files like `package-lock.json` to focus on relevant files. Ideal for quickly gathering file context for AI or code analysis.

## Usage
1. Place `genf.py` in the target folder.
2. Run with `python genf.py`.
3. Check the output file (e.g., `folder_name.txt`) for results.
